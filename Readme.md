In Blockchain Voting dApp - A Secure & Transparent Election Platform
A secure, full-stack decentralized application for conducting elections, built on the Ethereum blockchain. This project demonstrates a complete workflow from administrator setup to voter self-registration and secure voting, featuring a React frontend, a Node.js backend for secure hashing, and a Solidity smart contract.
üìñ Project Overview
The goal of this project is to solve the challenges of trust and transparency in traditional voting systems. By leveraging blockchain technology, this dApp ensures that every vote is immutable, verifiable, and anonymous, while the election process itself is managed by a transparent and auditable smart contract.
This application is designed with a clear separation of concerns, utilizing a full-stack architecture to provide a secure and scalable solution.
Core Architecture
The system is composed of three main components that work in concert:
1. Smart Contract (The Trust Layer): Written in Solidity, this is the single source of truth. It lives on the Ethereum blockchain and enforces all the rules of the election: who can vote, when they can vote, and that each person can only vote once. Its logic is transparent and cannot be altered once deployed.
2. Backend Server (The Security & Helper Layer): A Node.js/Express server that handles off-chain operations that would be insecure or inefficient to perform on the frontend. Its primary role is to securely hash sensitive user data (like an Aadhaar number) before it's sent to the smart contract, acting as a gatekeeper for valid registration.
3. Frontend Application (The User Interface): A responsive React application that provides an intuitive interface for both voters and the election administrator. It communicates with the user's MetaMask wallet to interact with the smart contract on the blockchain.

‚ú® Key Features
* Role-Based Access Control: A clear distinction between the contract owner (admin) and voters, enforced by modifiers within the smart contract.
* Secure Self-Registration: Voters can register themselves using a unique identifier. This identifier is first processed by a secure backend to prevent on-chain storage of sensitive data and to ensure validity.
* Immutable & Transparent Voting: Every vote is a transaction recorded on the blockchain, ensuring it cannot be tampered with or deleted. The require statements in the smart contract prevent invalid actions like double-voting or voting outside the election window.
* Two-Step Ownership Transfer: A secure, industry-standard protocol for changing the administrator of the dApp, preventing accidental loss of control.
* Decentralized Lifecycle Management: The entire election lifecycle‚Äîfrom adding candidates to starting and finalizing the election‚Äîis controlled by calling functions on the deployed smart contract.
üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack
* Frontend: React.js, Ethers.js (v6), Tailwind CSS, React Router
* Backend: Node.js, Express.js
* Blockchain: Solidity, Ganache (for local development)
* Development & Tooling: Remix IDE, MetaMask, npm
üöÄ Getting Started
Follow these instructions to get a local copy of the project up and running for development and testing.
Prerequisites
* Node.js and npm installed on your machine.
* Ganache installed for running a local blockchain.
* MetaMask browser extension installed and configured.
Installation & Setup
1. Clone the Repository:
git clone https://github.com/ArcDemon0703/blockchain-voting-app.git
cd blockchain-voting-app

2. Set up the Backend:
   * Navigate to the backend directory: cd backend
   * Install dependencies: npm install
   3. Set up the Frontend:
   * From the root directory, navigate to the frontend directory: cd voting
   * Install dependencies: npm install
Running the Application
   1. Start Your Local Blockchain: Open the Ganache application and start a "Quickstart" workspace. Ensure "Auto-mining" is enabled in the settings.
   2. Deploy the Smart Contract:
   * Open the BlockchainVoting.sol contract in Remix IDE.
   * Compile and deploy it to your running Ganache instance (using MetaMask).
   * Copy the deployed contract address.
   3. Configure the Frontend:
   * Open voting/src/App.js and paste the new contract address into the CONTRACT_ADDRESS constant.
   * Open voting/src/contracts/Voting.json and update the ABI if you've made any changes to the smart contract.
   4. Start the Servers:
   * Backend: In a terminal at the backend directory, run: node server.js
   * Frontend: In a separate terminal at the voting directory, run: npm start
Your application will be live at http://localhost:3000.
üîÆ Future Improvements
   * Secure Admin Login: Implement a two-factor authentication system for the admin, combining a wallet signature with a password managed by the backend.
   * UI/UX Enhancements: Redesign the Voter Portal and Results page for a more intuitive and visually appealing user experience.
   * Public Testnet Deployment: Deploy the smart contract to a public testnet like Sepolia to allow for wider testing and demonstration.
   * Event-Driven Updates: Refactor the frontend to listen for smart contract events (e.g., VoteCasted) for more efficient, real-time updates instead of just re-fetching data.
